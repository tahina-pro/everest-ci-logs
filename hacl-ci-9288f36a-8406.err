Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls FStar.Monotonic.RRef.m_recall (going into FStar) -- removing the static qualifier from FStar.Monotonic.RRef.m_recall
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block (going into Hacl) -- removing the static qualifier from Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block
Warning 8: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block (going into Hacl). This is a call across translation units but Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block has a C "inline" qualifier. The C standard allows removing Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block from its translation unit (see C11 6.7.3 §5), and CompCert will do it. 
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_last_pass (going into Hacl) -- removing the static qualifier from Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_last_pass
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.AEAD.Encrypt.encrypt (going into Crypto_AEAD) calls Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.__proj__Acc__item__a (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) -- removing the static qualifier from Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.__proj__Acc__item__a
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.KrmlTest.test (going into Crypto_KrmlTest) calls Crypto.AEAD.Encrypt.encrypt (going into Crypto_AEAD) -- removing the static qualifier from Crypto.AEAD.Encrypt.encrypt
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.KrmlTest.test (going into Crypto_KrmlTest) calls Crypto.AEAD.Decrypt.decrypt (going into Crypto_AEAD) -- removing the static qualifier from Crypto.AEAD.Decrypt.decrypt
