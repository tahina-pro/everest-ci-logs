Warning 8: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block (going into Hacl). This is a call across translation units but Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block has a C "inline" qualifier. The C standard allows removing Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block from its translation unit (see C11 6.7.3 §5), and CompCert will do it.
