Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.MAC.update (going into Crypto_Symmetric_MAC) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update (going into Hacl) -- removing the static qualifier from Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update
Warning 8: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.MAC.update (going into Crypto_Symmetric_MAC) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update (going into Hacl). This is a call across translation units but Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update has a C "inline" qualifier. The C standard allows removing Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update from its translation unit (see C11 6.7.3 §5), and CompCert will do it. 
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.MAC.update (going into Crypto_Symmetric_MAC) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.mk_state (going into Hacl) -- removing the static qualifier from Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.mk_state
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls FStar.Monotonic.RRef.m_recall (going into FStar) -- removing the static qualifier from FStar.Monotonic.RRef.m_recall
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.verify (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_finish_ (going into Hacl) -- removing the static qualifier from Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_finish_
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.AEAD.Invariant.remaining_len_ok (going into Crypto_AEAD_Invariant) calls FStar.Mul.op_Star (going into FStar) -- removing the static qualifier from FStar.Mul.op_Star
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.AEAD.Decrypt.decrypt (going into Crypto_AEAD_Decrypt) calls Crypto.AEAD.Encoding.add_bytes (going into Crypto_AEAD_Encoding) -- removing the static qualifier from Crypto.AEAD.Encoding.add_bytes
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.AEAD.Decrypt.decrypt (going into Crypto_AEAD_Decrypt) calls Crypto.AEAD.Encoding.store_lengths (going into Crypto_AEAD_Encoding) -- removing the static qualifier from Crypto.AEAD.Encoding.store_lengths
Warning 7: : After inlining, Crypto.AEAD.Encrypt.encrypt (going into Crypto_AEAD_Encrypt) calls Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.__proj__Acc__item__a (going into Crypto_Symmetric_UF1CMA) -- removing the static qualifier from Crypto.Symmetric.UF1CMA.__proj__Acc__item__a
Warning 9: : Some globals did not compile to C values and must be initialized in the before starting main(). You did not provide a main function, so users of your library MUST MAKE SURE they call kremlinit_globals(); (see kremlinit.c)
